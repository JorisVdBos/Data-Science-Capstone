# Data science coursera track final project
This is my final project in the Coursera track "Data Science".  
The contents of the in this supository are ordered in these maps:
- Information: Here you will find detailed information on how I completed the project. You will see I have tried to construct all steps taken into functions, so it would be easy to read. For detailed information about the working of a function you can delve into the R scripts themselves.
- 00 Global: Here some default scripts are saved. The library file containes all the R libraries that are used throughout the coding in the project. In the settings script, I have gathered all the variables that can be tweaked throughout the project. That way you may change them and run the whole project again.
- 01 Load: Contains the scripst of handling the raw data such as downloading, sampling, loading into R and also the cleaning of the data.
